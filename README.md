# Favor Network

*"Those who want respect, give respet."* ~Tony Soprano

The favor network is the ultimate *decentralized* and *trustless* ledger to keep track of personal favors you owe to others and those that others owe to you. Not only does it allow you to honour all the promises you've made, but it gradually builds up a stove of reputation data, giving you an idea how *respectable* someone is when it comes to returning a favor.

However, the favor network is not a simple one-to-one ledger of promises, but rather a *living* and *organic* network where favors and promises may flow freely between all participants. Instead of promising someone to return the favor, you might reward them with a pledge you received yourself, leaving it to them to redeem that favor.

The raison d'Ãªtre of the favor network is to break the one sided relationships in human interactions and permit promises to find their way back to their origins, promoting a culture of generosity and preventing the formation of [givers and takers](https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_are_you_a_giver_or_a_taker).

## Status Network + Favor Network = :heart:

When was the last time you opened your browser, loaded a website and logged in just to ask your friend something? Probably a long time ago! Most of our day-to-day interactions revolve around chat rooms through our mobile phones. To make tracking favors feasible, it must be invisible yet omnipresent in our discussions. *It must be as simple as plain old asking for it.*

Enter the [Status Network](https://status.im/). On the surface Status seems little more than a mobile messanger application, however it is a fully decentralized end-to-end encrypted communication platform with access to both the Ethereum blockchain as well as the Swarm file system.

By integrating the [Favor Network](https://favor.network/) seamlessly into Status, users can ask, accept and honour favors as seamlessly as sending messages to one another. All of this while preserving privacy (Whisper), guaranteeing correctness (Ethereum) and minimizing consensus costs (Swarm).
